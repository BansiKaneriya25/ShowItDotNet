Primary Key - only one

more than one primary we can create in one table - composite key

why we need PK?
NULL should not be allowed
it should be unique
it can not be modified

Forign Key - relation between two table
- provide a mechanism for linking a data store in multiple table and retrieving them in efficient manner.
- FK - NULL should be accept

Unique key - all data should be unique and null valcue consider only one time of column constraint is allow null

PK VS UK:
NULL should not allowed   -> NULL only one time we can insert
can't modified     ->  can modified

Identity  - applied in column level in perticular table
Seed & Increment
